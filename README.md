# DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in the field of medical imaging and disease diagnosis, especially when it comes to challenging problems like Diabetic Retinopathy, a dangerous condition marked by uncontrolled and abnormal cell division in the retina. The goal of this work is to distinguish between areas with and without diabetic retinopathy in retinal images from diabetic patients by using convolutional neural networks for image processing and data augmentation. Using the transfer learning approach, the study goes on to assess how well a new CNN model performs in comparison to well-known pre-trained models like VGG-16, ResNet-50, MobileNet, and EfficientB0. Even with the very limited dataset used, the outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the suggested CNN model. This study shows how well our model performs, beating competing pre-trained models in accuracy and needing far less processing resources. The results point to the possibility of the suggested Deep Retina model as a useful instrument for the precise and effective classification of diabetic retinopathy in medical imaging applications. We developed a web application that supports the people in getting answers to their inquiries and understanding the gravity of their situation using the best model and flask applicaiton using python.
